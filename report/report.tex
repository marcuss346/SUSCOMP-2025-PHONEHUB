\section{Introduction}
This project investigates how university students manage smartphones throughout their lifecycle and how these decisions relate to environmental awareness and e-waste production. The aim is to identify student patterns in device replacement, reuse, repair, recycling and disposal, while also exploring the motivations, barriers and knowledge that shape sustainable or unsustainable behaviour. Results of the study will contribute to a better understanding of e-waste generation among young consumers and support the development of initiatives that promote responsible smartphone use, repair and recycling.
